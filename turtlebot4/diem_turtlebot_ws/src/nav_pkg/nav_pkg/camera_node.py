    QRCodeReader is a ROS2 node for reading and decoding QR codes from image frames.

    This node subscribes to an image topic, processes incoming images to detect QR codes,
    and publishes the decoded commands. It uses OpenCV for image processing and a QR code 
    reader library for decoding.

    Attributes:
        command_queue (list): A queue to store detected commands.
        saving_time (float): The time when the last command was saved.
        expiration_time (float): The time threshold for considering a command as expired.
        detection_time (float): The time when a command was detected.

    Methods:
        __init__(): Initializes the QRCodeReader node.
        camera_callback(data): Callback function for processing incoming images.
        publish_command(command): Manages the command detection and saves it in the command queue.
        decodeframe(frame): Decodes a QR code from a given image frame.
